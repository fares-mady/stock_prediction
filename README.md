# 📈 Stock Price Prediction with LSTM
This project provides a deep learning-based approach to forecast stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses it, trains an LSTM model per stock, and visualizes both short-term predictions and future price forecasts.

🚀 Features:
* 📥 Automatic Data Fetching from Yahoo Finance

* 🔄 Data Preprocessing and Scaling

* 🧠 LSTM Model architecture with Dropout to prevent overfitting

* 📊 Prediction and Future Forecasting (customizable days ahead)

* 📈 Beautiful Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

* 🧩 Modular Design — Easily extend or plug in other models

🛠️ Tech Stack:
* Python

* pandas, numpy, yfinance

* matplotlib, seaborn

* scikit-learn

* TensorFlow / Keras
