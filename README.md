# 📈 Stock Price Prediction with LSTM
This project provides a deep learning-based approach to forecast stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses it, trains an LSTM model per stock, and visualizes both short-term predictions and future price forecasts.

**🚀 Features:**
* 📥 Automatic Data Fetching from Yahoo Finance

* 🔄 Data Preprocessing and Scaling

* 🧠 LSTM Model architecture with Dropout to prevent overfitting

* 📊 Prediction and Future Forecasting (customizable days ahead)

* 📈 Beautiful Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

* 🧩 Modular Design — Easily extend or plug in other models

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
* Python

* pandas, numpy, yfinance

* matplotlib, seaborn

* scikit-learn

* TensorFlow / Keras

**📦 Installation:**
git clone https://github.com/fares-mady/stock-lstm-predictor.git
cd stock-lstm-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt

**🧪 How to Use:**
python your_script_name.py
Or modify the main() function to test specific stocks or adjust prediction days.

**📝 Example Output**
* Training vs Predicted prices

* Future forecast plotted on the same chart

* Console output of future predicted values
